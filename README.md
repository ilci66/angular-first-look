# First Angular Project
I kept avoiding angular because it was neither the most popular nor the most liked framework by the web developers but I feel like it's about time I start learning.
I will teach myself angular framework by creating a fully functional website for a gym
## Project Goal
I wanna be able to use the angular framework for my future projects.

## Impressions
*   The logic to fetch data and stuff is handled in services, not too hard to make sense of
